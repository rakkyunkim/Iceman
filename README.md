This is a graphical game where the Iceman digs through the oil field and gathers oil barrels while avoiding protesters that are moving around the field. 
I worked on this project in my CS30 class (Advanced Programming in C++). I had a lot of fun making this game, and was exposed to a variety of challenges trying to implement a good object oriented programming principles.

Used OpenGL and FreeGLUT for graphics.
